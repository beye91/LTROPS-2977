** Cross-Domain Automation with Cisco DNA Center and ACI using CI/CD Pipelines **

Building a cross-domain automation pipeline with Cisco DNA Center and ACI can help to simplify and speed up the process of configuration deployment from development to production environment. In this lab session, the participants will work to build the bridge between these two domains and include both in an automated CI/CD pipeline using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Using CI/CD practices can also help reduce the risk of human error and improve the overall quality of configuration deployments.

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

+ Create and manage your own projects in GitLab
+ Setup GitLab runner both for Shell (CLI) and Docker
+ Build docker images with automation tools
+ Define a simple pipeline that will run against multiple domains (DNAC & ACI)
+ Define more complex pipelines with artifacts and multiple stages

This code is based on the lab guide accessible via https://crossdomain-automation.tech/
